Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room and they currently run an Android application called Draw It or Lose It. The purpose of this project was aid in the expansion of the new game into multiple platforms. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found it extremely helpful to review what the client was asking for and what was required of the program. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would be a bit more detailed and include information that is missing from my software design document. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the user's needs when desigining a software document to ensure the project is going to meet the needs of the client.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Focusing on the purpose of the program and what the client wanted the end goal of the program to be was useful in designing the software document.
